## Hola, quÃ© tal? ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ 
- My name is Jaime Bowen, I'm an Aerospace Engineering Graduate with a great interest in the applications of machine learning ðŸ¤–  to real world problems.
- At the moment I'm studying the Master of Computer Science at WPI
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Machine Learning applied to CFD and futures trading
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust ðŸ¦€ 
- ðŸ¤– I have experience in NLP, aerospace + ML/DL, ATM + ML/DL, automatic trading, etc...


## Projects and works

### On-going
* [Clare-db](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db): open source initiative that wants to help researchers in need of computational aerodynamic data
* [Tacoma lib](https://github.com/TACOMA-INTA/tacoma-lib): python library for applying Machine Learning in CFD
* [WPI courses repo](https://github.com/404): codes from the courses

## Machine Learning stuff
* [Some RNN implementations for classification](https://github.com/jaimebw/chill_rnns)

### Utilites
* [Jupyter Notebook Cell Extractor](https://github.com/jaimebw/jupyter_cell_extractor): a little library to extract Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) cells to Latex files
* [Youtube song extractor](https://github.com/jaimebw/song_extractor): utility for transforming whole videos of YouTube into different songs
### Thesis and reseach work
* [MSc in Aerospace thesis code and document](https://github.com/jaimebw/tfm): prediction of bearing conditions using PCA and autoencoders.
* [BSc in Aerospace thesis code and document](https://github.com/jaimebw/tfg): prediction of conflicts between aircraft in an airspace using Machine Learning (just available in Spanish -_- )
### Other stuff
* [Coding interview questions](https://github.com/jaimebw/coding_interviews_tests)
