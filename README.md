## Hola, quÃ© tal? ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ 
- I like motorbikes, aircraft, coding and old books.

## Projects and works
- [Nabla](https://github.com/jaimebw/nabla): a cool Flask based app for running Open Foam. It is WIP, but you can test and let me know what you think.
### On-going
* [Clare-db](https://github.com/jaimebw/clare-db): open source initiative that wants to help researchers in need of computational aerodynamic data
* [Tacoma lib](https://github.com/TACOMA-INTA/tacoma-lib): python library for applying Machine Learning in CFD

### Utilites
* [Jupyter Notebook Cell Extractor](https://github.com/jaimebw/jupyter_cell_extractor): a little library to extract Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) cells to Latex files
### Thesis and reseach work
* [MSc in Aerospace thesis code and document](https://github.com/jaimebw/tfm): prediction of bearing conditions using PCA and autoencoders.
* [BSc in Aerospace thesis code and document](https://github.com/jaimebw/tfg): prediction of conflicts between aircraft in an airspace using Machine Learning (just available in Spanish -_- )
